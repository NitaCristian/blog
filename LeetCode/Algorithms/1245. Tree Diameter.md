# Approach: DFS
This problem is very similar to other problems about tree diameters, the only difference is that we don't have a specified root and we are given the graph as a list of edges not as a graph data structure.

After building the graph as an adjacency list we use an algorithm for finding the maximum diameter of an n-ary tree.
For each node we find the 2 greatest paths of their children and try to update the maximum diameter as if that node would be in the middle of a path and it joins two other child paths.
Otherwise we return the greatest path as if the current node is just part of the longest path of the diameter and not an inflection point.

class Solution:
    def treeDiameter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(edges) == 0:
            return 0

        adj = defaultdict(list)
        n = len(edges) + 1

        for u, v in edges:
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)

        diameter = 0
        visited = [False] * n

        def dfs(curr, visited):
            nonlocal diameter

            max_distance1, max_distance2 = 0, 0
            distance = 0
            visited[curr] = True

            for neighbor in adj[curr]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    distance = 1 + dfs(neighbor, visited)

                if distance > max_distance1:
                    max_distance1, max_distance2 = distance, max_distance1
                elif distance > max_distance2:
                    max_distance2 = distance

                diameter = max(diameter, max_distance1 + max_distance2)
            return max_distance1

        dfs(0, visited)
        return diameter
