# Explanation

This problem is just a simulation problem. Meaning you have to simulate what the problem statement tells you, there is no trick to speed up the calculation.

At each step you take the pile with the maximum number of gits and leave behind the square root of that number. You do this k times.
# Approach: Heap
The only thing in this problem that can be adjusted is the method for finding the largest pile of gits. We can use a priority queue that maintains an ordered list of items with the largest one at the top.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long pickGifts(vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        long long answer = 0;
        for (auto gift : gifts) {
            pq.push(gift);
            answer += gift;
        }

        while (k--) {
            auto gift = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int remaining = sqrt(gift);
            answer -= gift - remaining;
            pq.push(remaining);
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
