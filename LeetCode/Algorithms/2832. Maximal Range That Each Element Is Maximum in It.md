# Explanation
For each element we need to find the longest subarray that contains this element and in which the current element is the maximum.
For example in the array 1, 5, 4, 3.
1 can only be part of a subarray of length 1 (itself) that contains it and in which he is the maximum.
But in the case of 5, all the elements are smaller than it thus the whole array of length 4 is the subarray that respects the conditions.
In the case of 4, only 3 is smaller than it and thus the maximum length is 2. Because 5 is greater than it, if we include it in the subarray then 4 won't be the maximum element anymore.

The brute force approach for solving this problem would be iterating over every number and starting two pointers, one going left and one going right until we either get to the end of the subarray, or we find an element greater than it.

We need however to find a more efficient approach to cut the repeated work?
# Approach: Monotonic Stack Decresing
Where even is that repeated work?
Lets take the case of this array 1, 2, 4, 3 and only focus on the left pointer.
First we process 1 and nothing is greater to the left and we end up at the beginning. 
Then we take 2 and start with the pointer again, and again it goes to the beginning. This means nothing is greater than it.
Then we take 4 and the same thing happens.
When we take 3 an idea should pop in our heads. If the current element is greater than the previous then it goes until that previous element stopped. Otherwise the previous element becomes the new stop condition.
Ok but what if the current element is greater than the previous one like 4 is greater than 2 but is also greater than the element that stopped 2. 
Like in this example: 1 10 3 8 4 5 6 9 7

4 5 6 go to the left until they get to 8.
But 9 can get further up to 10. So we not only have to check if its greater than the previous stop element, it needs to check the previous one as well.

We would maintain a data structure like a list that would look like this: 10, 8
and then 9 beats 8 but not 10.
This is a monotonically decreasing stack.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maximumLengthOfRanges(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> left(n), right(n);
        stack<int> idxStack;

        // Calculate left boundaries
        for (int currIdx = 0; currIdx < n; ++currIdx) {
            while (!idxStack.empty() && nums[idxStack.top()] < nums[currIdx]) {
                idxStack.pop();
            }
            left[currIdx] = idxStack.empty() ? -1 : idxStack.top();
            idxStack.push(currIdx);
        }

        // Clear the stack for reuse
        while (!idxStack.empty()) idxStack.pop();

        // Calculate right boundaries
        for (int currIdx = n - 1; currIdx >= 0; --currIdx) {
            while (!idxStack.empty() && nums[idxStack.top()] < nums[currIdx]) {
                idxStack.pop();
            }
            right[currIdx] = idxStack.empty() ? n : idxStack.top();
            idxStack.push(currIdx);
        }

        // Calculate the maximal range for each element
        vector<int> maxRanges(n);
        for (int currIdx = 0; currIdx < n; ++currIdx) {
            maxRanges[currIdx] = right[currIdx] - left[currIdx] - 1;
        }

        return maxRanges;
    }
};

### Space Complexity
# Approach: Monotonic Increasing
We can perform the same algorithm but with a single pass instead of two.
The processing now happens when we remove items from the increasing stack.
We keep a monotonically increasing stack and After popping, the new top of the stack represents the index of the first element to the left that is greater than or equal to the current element. If the stack is empty, the left boundary is `-1`. When an element is popped, the current index (`right`) is its right boundary because this is the first larger element (or the end of the array).
