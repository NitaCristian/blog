# Approach: BFS
Traverse the binary tree level by level.
This can be done using a variation of the BFS algorithm.
In the BFS algorithm's main loop, while the queue is not empty, set a maximum value to -inf.

Then traverse all the nodes present at this level. 
This is done using a for loop that traverses the range formed by the current queue length.
Check if the current value is the new maximum for this level, then add more nodes to the queue if there are any children for the current node.
The algorithm doesn't process the new children nodes added since it processes only as many nodes are in the current level due to the for loop.
If there are 5 nodes in the current level, only 5 will be extracted from the queue, regardless of how many more we add.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []

        queue = deque([root])
        answer = []

        while queue:
            maximum = float("-inf")
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                curr = queue.popleft()
                maximum = max(maximum, curr.val)

                if curr.left:
                    queue.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    queue.append(curr.right)
                
            answer.append(maximum)

        return answer
