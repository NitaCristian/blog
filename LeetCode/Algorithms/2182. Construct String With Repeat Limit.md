# Approach: Greedy
This is the more intuitive approach.
You count all the characters and then you think how can you make the lexicographically larger string out of those characters and their counts such that a character may not repeat more than the limit.

Well, easy. You start with the lexicographically larger character and append it to the result the minimum number of times between the limit and the current count;

If the count of this largest characters is still greater than 0, then you must insert the previous largest character in between this string and the next one. Like if I have 5 characters of z and 1 of y with the repeat limit being 3. I can construct the first string of zzz and in between this and the next zz string I have to insert the previous lexicographically larger character y to construct zzzyzz such that no repeated character has a count larger than the limit.

If you inserted this character in between, decrease its count. If you haven't found one that it is smaller, then the algorithm is over since we are at the last character anyway and can't use it anymore without a spacer character.

You keep track of the counts with a frequency array and traverse the alphabet in reverse using an index.

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string repeatLimitedString(string s, int repeatLimit) {
        vector freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }

        string answer;

        int curr_idx = 25;
        while (curr_idx >= 0) {
            if (freq[curr_idx] == 0) {
                curr_idx--;
                continue;
            }

            int use = min(freq[curr_idx], repeatLimit);
            answer += string(use, char(curr_idx + 'a'));
            freq[curr_idx] -= use;

            if (freq[curr_idx] > 0) {
                int prev_idx = curr_idx - 1;
                while (prev_idx >= 0 && freq[prev_idx] == 0)
                    prev_idx--;

                if (prev_idx < 0)
                    break;

                answer += char(prev_idx + 'a');
                freq[prev_idx]--;

            }
        }

        return answer;
    }

# Approach: Max Heap
It follows the same approach but you don't keep track of an index and instead you use a max heap to give you the largest character and their count. You apply the same logic as above but with this data structure.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string repeatLimitedString(string s, int repeatLimit) {
        vector<int> freq(26);
        for (char c : s)
            freq[c - 'a']++;

        priority_queue<pair<char, int>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] == 0) continue;
            pq.push({char(i + 'a'), freq[i]});
        }

        string answer;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [curr, curr_count] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            int use = min(curr_count, repeatLimit);
            answer += string(use, curr);

            if (curr_count > use && !pq.empty()) {
                auto [prev, prev_count] = pq.top();
                pq.pop();

                answer += prev;
                if (prev_count > 1) 
                    pq.push({prev, prev_count - 1});

                pq.push({curr, curr_count - use});
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
