# Approach: DFS
The diameter can be computed at each node in the following way.
We can either sum up the left and right paths and compare it against a maximum diameter or return the maximum path between the left and the right plus 1, the child to parent edge.
The current node is either an inflection point in the diameter of the binary tree or is party of the path of the diameter.
## Code
### C++
### C\#
### Python
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        diameter = 0
        def dfs(root):
            nonlocal diameter
            if not root:
                return 0
        
            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)

            diameter = max(diameter, left + right)
            return max(left, right) + 1

        dfs(root)
        return diameter
```
