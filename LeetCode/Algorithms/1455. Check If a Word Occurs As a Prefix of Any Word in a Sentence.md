# Problem Statement
Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**, and a `searchWord`, check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return _the index of the word in_ `sentence` _(**1-indexed**) where_ `searchWord` _is a prefix of this word_. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If there is no such word return `-1`.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.
## Constraints
- `1 <= sentence.length <= 100`
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 10`
- `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
## Example 2
**Input:** sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
## Example 3
**Input:** sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
# Hints
- First extract the words of the sentence.
- Check for each word if searchWord occurs at index 0, if so return the index of this word (1-indexed)
- If searchWord doesn't exist as a prefix of any word return the default value (-1).
# Explanation
Since words are clearly delimited by spaces, we need to extract the words and then perform an algorithm to check if s search word is a prefix of a word in the sentence.
# Approach: Brute Force

Clearly if the word in the sentence has a smaller length than the search word, then the search word can't be a prefix.
Then we use an index to traverse both strings up to the minimum of their two lengths, if don't match at some point we mark it with a bool.

To parse the sentence we use stringstream in C++ and extract words very easily. For C# or Python we could use built in functions to split the string at spaces.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int isPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord) {
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        
        int wordIndex = 1;
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            if (word.size() >= searchWord.size()) {
                int n = min(word.size(), searchWord.size());
                int isPrefix = true;
                for (int i = 0; i < n && isPrefix; i++) {
                    if (word[i] != searchWord[i]) {
                        isPrefix = false;
                    }
                }
                // if (word.find(searchWord) == 0)
                if (isPrefix) {
                    return wordIndex;
                }

            }
            
            wordIndex++;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
### C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int IsPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord) {
        string[] words = sentence.Split(new[] { ' ' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
        
        int wordIndex = 1;
        foreach (var word in words) {
            if (word.StartsWith(searchWord)) 
                return wordIndex;
            wordIndex++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int:
        words = sentence.split(" ")

        wordIndex = 1
        for word in words:
            if (word.startswith(searchWord)):
                return wordIndex
            wordIndex += 1

        return -1
```
## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The algorithm first splits the `sentence` into individual words using built-in functions. This process involves iterating through all n characters of the string once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Next, for each word extracted from the sentence, the algorithm compares the first m characters of the word with the `searchWord`. This comparison is done using a built-in function that checks the prefix of length m, which takes O(m) time per word. Since there are w words in the `sentence`, this part of the algorithm takes O(w⋅m) time.

Combining both parts, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(n+w⋅m).
### Space Complexity
The algorithm uses built-in functions that process the input `sentence` directly, requiring O(n) space to store the `sentence` string. The `currentWord` variable temporarily holds one word at a time, requiring O(k) space, but this space is reused across iterations. Additionally, the algorithm uses constant space O(1) for variables like `wordPosition`. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
# Approach: Two Pointers

Another approach would be to use Two Pointers technique and check the string like that. One pointer for the input string and one for the search word. Skip spaces, check if search word is prefix, advance input string pointer to end of word and do this in a loop until the end of the string.

Traverse the string using a pointer and keep another one for traversing the search word.
If there is a match advance the search word pointer, if not reset it back to 0.
If it had advanced to the end, return the index of the word.
Otherwise return -1.

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int isPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord) {
        int currentWordPosition = 1;
        int currentIndex = 0;

        int sentenceLength = sentence.length();
        while (currentIndex < sentenceLength) {
            skipSpaces(currentIndex, sentence, currentWordPosition);
            int matchCount = countMatches(currentIndex, sentence, searchWord);

            if (matchCount == searchWord.length())
                return currentWordPosition;

            skipToEndOfWord(currentIndex, sentence);
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

private:
    void skipSpaces(int &currentIndex, const string &sentence, int &currentWordPosition) {
        int sentenceLength = sentence.size();
        while (currentIndex < sentenceLength && sentence[currentIndex] == ' ') {
            currentIndex++;
            currentWordPosition++;
        }
    }

    int countMatches(int &currentIndex, const string &sentence, const string &searchWord) {
        int sentenceLength = sentence.size();
        int matchCount = 0;
        while (currentIndex < sentenceLength &&
            matchCount < searchWord.length() &&
            sentence[currentIndex] == searchWord[matchCount]) {
            currentIndex++;
            matchCount++;
        }
        return matchCount;
    }

    void skipToEndOfWord(int &currentIndex, const string &sentence) {
        int sentenceLength = sentence.size();
        while (currentIndex < sentenceLength &&
            sentence[currentIndex] != ' ') {
            currentIndex++;
        }
    }
};

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The algorithm processes the input string `sentence` in a single pass. During this traversal, it skips spaces to identify the start of each word, checks for a prefix match between `searchWord` and the current word, and moves to the end of the word if there is no match. This traversal covers all n characters in `sentence`.

Additionally, for each word in `sentence`, the algorithm compares up to m characters with `searchWord` to check for a prefix match. In the worst case, this adds an O(m) cost for the comparison. Since each word is processed exactly once, the prefix-checking step is effectively absorbed into the overall traversal of n, making the total time complexity O(n+m).
### Space Complexity
The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. Variables like `currentWordPosition`, `currentIndex`, and `matchCount` are simple integers, and there are no auxiliary data structures (e.g., arrays) used to store intermediate results. Thus, the space complexity is O(1).
