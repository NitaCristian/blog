# Approach: Heap
So you have the ratios for every class and you want to increase the pass ratio for the class with the lowest ratio such that it is maximized.
Ok so clearly the perfect data structure for this is a heap. We maintain a heap of the ratio, and the pass and total students then update the one with the smallest ratio.
This however doesn't work! Why? The current heap prioritizes the current lowest ratio, not the potential one. We need to update the one that needs it the most.

The first solution works because it explicitly prioritizes classes based on the **incremental improvement** an extra student can bring. The second solution fails because it uses the current pass ratio, which does not consider the effect of adding extra students
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double maxAverageRatio(vector<vector<int>>& classes, int extraStudents) {
        // Lambda to calculate the gain of adding an extra student
        auto calculateGain = [](int passes, int totalStudents) {
            return (double)(passes + 1) / (totalStudents + 1) -
                   (double)passes / totalStudents;
        };

        // Max heap to store (-gain, passes, totalStudents)
        priority_queue<pair<double, pair<int, int>>> maxHeap;
        for (const auto& singleClass : classes) {
            maxHeap.push({calculateGain(singleClass[0], singleClass[1]),
                          {singleClass[0], singleClass[1]}});
        }

        // Distribute extra students
        while (extraStudents--) {
            auto [currentGain, classInfo] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            int passes = classInfo.first;
            int totalStudents = classInfo.second;
            maxHeap.push({calculateGain(passes + 1, totalStudents + 1),
                          {passes + 1, totalStudents + 1}});
        }

        // Calculate the final average pass ratio
        double totalPassRatio = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            auto [_, classInfo] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            totalPassRatio += (double)classInfo.first / classInfo.second;
        }

        return totalPassRatio / classes.size();
    }
};
```
### C\#
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAverageRatio(self, classes: List[List[int]], extraStudents: int) -> float:
        def gain(passes, total_students):
            return (passes + 1) / (total_students + 1) - passes / total_students

        max_heap = [
            (-gain(passes, total_students), passes, total_students)
            for passes, total_students in classes
        ]
        heapify(max_heap)

        for _ in range(extraStudents):
            current_gain, passes, total_students = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            heapq.heappush(
                max_heap,
                (-gain(passes + 1, total_students + 1), passes + 1, total_students + 1),
            )

        total_pass_ratio = sum(
            passes / total_students for _, passes, total_students in max_heap
        ) / len(classes)

        return total_pass_ratio
