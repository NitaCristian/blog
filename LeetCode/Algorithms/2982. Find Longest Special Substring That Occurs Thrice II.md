# Approach
Same as 2981 but with bigger string sizes.
How can we even optimize this?

Pretty easy. For each character we store 3 lengths.
Imagine we have a string like this: aaabaaabaaaa. There are three groups of a's with length 3, 3, 4. The minimum between all of them is 3 and we know that the substring that occurs thrice is of length 3.

But what if we had aaab?
well the first substring size is of 1, then 2, then 3.
but the min between all of them is 1 so with this example the longest substring is a.

what in the case of aaabaa?
after iterating over the first group we have 1, 2, 3
and after the second one we have 2, 2, 3.
we updated the length of 1 since we have found another length of 2.

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int& min(int& a, int& b, int& c) {
        return a < (b < c ? b : c) ? a : b < c ? b : c;
    }
    int maximumLength(string s) {
        int substringLength = 0, ans = -1;
        char previousCharacter;
        vector<vector<int>> substringLengths(26, vector<int>(3, -1));
        for (char character : s) {
            if (character == previousCharacter) {
                substringLength++;
            } else {
                substringLength = 1;
                previousCharacter = character;
            }
            // Replace the minimum frequency with the current length, if it is
            // greater.
            int& minLength = min(substringLengths[character - 'a'][0],
                                 substringLengths[character - 'a'][1],
                                 substringLengths[character - 'a'][2]);
            if (substringLength > minLength) minLength = substringLength;
        }

        // Find the character with the maximum value of its minimum frequency.
        for (char character = 'a'; character <= 'z'; character++)
            ans = max(ans, min(substringLengths[character - 'a'][0],
                               substringLengths[character - 'a'][1],
                               substringLengths[character - 'a'][2]));
        return ans;
    }
};

        substring_length = 0
        ans = -1

                previous_character = character

            # Replace the minimum frequency with the current length, if it is
            # greater.
            min_length = min(substring_lengths[ord(character) - ord("a")])
            if substring_length > min_length:
                substring_lengths[ord(character) - ord("a")][
                    substring_lengths[ord(character) - ord("a")].index(
                        min_length
                    )
                ] = substring_length

        # Find the character with the maximum value of its minimum frequency.
        for char_idx in range(26):
            ans = max(ans, min(substring_lengths[char_idx]))

        return ans
