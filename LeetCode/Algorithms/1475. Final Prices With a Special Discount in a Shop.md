# Approach: Monotonic Stack
So for each element that i am going to process from left to right, I want the first element that is less than or equal to it.

## Code
### C++
### C\#
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer = prices.copy()

        stack = []
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            while stack and prices[i] <= prices[stack[-1]]:
                answer[stack[-1]] -= prices[i]
                stack.pop()

            stack.append(i)

        return answer
```
