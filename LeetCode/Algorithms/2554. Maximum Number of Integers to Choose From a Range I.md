# Explanation
This is an extremely easy problem, almost dumb I would say.

First of all, the problem statement tells us this:
The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`

Which means that the chosen integers can have a sum lower than maxSum. We don't have to create that sum using as many integers as possible.

If we have the maxSum = 15 two numbers that give us that sum is  7 and 8. But at the same time, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 also give us that sum. This should somewhat give you an understanding that we can really just choose in order from 1 to n the smallest numbers that aren't banned and their sum shouldn't exceed maxSum. This by the way resembles prefixSum technique.

Like that's the whole problem. Now comes the task of finding if a number isn't banned. 3 methods come to mind: binary search on the banned array after sorting, sweep which is a sort of two pointers on the sorted banned array, or a data structure like set, map, or frequency array to mark banned elements.

At first when i saw those tags like prefix sum, sorting, greedy, binary search i though how can i even use them? Only greedy and somewhat prefix sum( more like cummulative sum) really applies here. turns out the other techniques mentioned are only used to find if a number is banned or not. I though that i should use binary search on the number of integers and i should use prefix sum and the banned array for some calculations but no.
# Approach: Binary Search

## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCount(vector<int>& banned, int n, int maxSum) {
        // Sort banned array to enable binary search
        sort(banned.begin(), banned.end());

        int count = 0;

        // Try each number from 1 to n
        for (int num = 1; num <= n; num++) {
            // Skip if number is in banned array
            if (customBinarySearch(banned, num)) continue;

            maxSum -= num;

            // Break if sum exceeds our limit
            if (maxSum < 0) break;

            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

private:
    // Helper method to check if value exists in sorted array
    bool customBinarySearch(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == target) return true;

            if (arr[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};

                // Handle duplicate banned numbers
                while (bannedIdx < banned.size() && banned[bannedIdx] == num) {
                    bannedIdx++;
                }
            } else {
                // Include current number if possible
                maxSum -= num;
                if (maxSum >= 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
