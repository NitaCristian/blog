# Explanation
Given a **non-decreasing** integer array `arrival` of size `n`, this means that people arrive in order.

Ok but what do the rules even mean?
Simple.
If two people arrive at the door at the same time, the one who wants to leave will go first. If somebody goes in a direction, then all the people waiting at the door to go in that direction will go with him.
So if two people arrive at time 1 and then some people who want to leave come next, then i am going to let all of them out, and then allow people who want to enter to go inside.
# Approach: Queue
How do i code this one up?
Using two queues for the people who leave and enter.
I put them in the queue with their arrival time and their position in the array.

Now the current time is originally 0.
But a person who wants to perform an action of leaving or entering will do it maybe a bit in the future or they may already be waiting.
So the current time is always set to the maximum between the curent time and the minimum between the arrival times of the two queues.

Now we let people leave and then let people in.
How many though?
We let people leave as long as their arrival time is less than or equal to the current time. Makes sense. They have been waiting and this is what the problem statement tells us, once you let one person out, let everyone who is waiting.

Now do the same for the people who want to enter. This is a simulation problem.
Do this while one of the queues becomes empty.
Then process the rest of the queue just like above, but to the end this time.

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> timeTaken(vector<int>& arrival, vector<int>& state) {
        int n = arrival.size();
        int time = 0;

        vector<int> answer(n);
        queue<pair<int, int>> enter, exit;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (state[i] == 0)
                enter.push({arrival[i], i});
            else
                exit.push({arrival[i], i});
        }

        while (!enter.empty() && !exit.empty()) {
            time = max(time, min(exit.front().first, enter.front().first));

            while (!exit.empty() && time >= exit.front().first) {
                answer[exit.front().second] = time++;
                exit.pop();
            }
            while (!enter.empty() && time >= enter.front().first) {
                answer[enter.front().second] = time++;
                enter.pop();
            }
        }

        while (!enter.empty()) {
            time = max(time, enter.front().first);
            answer[enter.front().second] = time++;
            enter.pop();
        }

        while (!exit.empty()) {
            time = max(time, exit.front().first);
            answer[exit.front().second] = time++;
            exit.pop();
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
