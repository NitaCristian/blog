# Approach: Merge Interval
We can think of each number x as an interval \[x - k, x + k].
Then we want to merge every interval and count how many we have merged into one.
Then we simply take the count of the interval with the highest count.

To simplify the process, we are going to sort the array such that if the current interval can't be merged with the previous one, this has become a new independent interval that all the rest are going to be checked against, since the previous one was too small, the other ones are also not going to be merged with it.

# Approach: Line Sweep
An interesting approach is to use this with prefix sum.
Image you have a number line and a few intervals.
If you again have the same interval idea but you want a faster approach than nlogn, you have to somehow mark on the number line that the interval is there.
You can increase the count from the start to end such that you end up with something like this.

1 2 2 2 3 3 2
So i could've had the intervals 1-6, 2-7, 5-7.

now the biggest value here is my answer.

But the way i described it here will take more than linear time, maybe even more than the previous.
To fix this you mark the start with +1 and (end + 1) with a -1 and then do prefix sum. Think about it, you add to the current value the previous value. if you currently have 0 then this cell is going to get covered by whats previously, 
if you have 1, great, a new interval starts
if you have -1 it means an interval ends here and

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBeauty(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // If there's only one element, the maximum beauty is 1
        if (nums.size() == 1) return 1;

        int maxBeauty = 0;
        int maxValue = 0;

        // Find the maximum value in the array
        for (int num : nums) maxValue = max(maxValue, num);

        // Create an array to keep track of the count changes
        vector<int> count(maxValue + 1, 0);

        // Update the count array for each value's range [val - k, val + k]
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[max(num - k, 0)]++;  // Increment at the start of the range
            if (num + k + 1 <= maxValue)
                count[num + k + 1]--;  // Decrement after the range
        }

        int currentSum = 0;  // Tracks the running sum of counts
        // Calculate the prefix sum and find the maximum value
        for (int val : count) {
            currentSum += val;
            maxBeauty = max(maxBeauty, currentSum);
        }

        return maxBeauty;
    }

# Approach: Sliding Window
Since we are interested in the number of overlapped intervals, we don't even need to perform the merge intervals algorithm fully.
We still have to sort, but we will only think about the numbers as intervals.

Ok, so how do intervals overlap or rather, don't.
Well number x can go up to x + k, and number y can go as lower as y - k, so if the distance from y to x is greater than 2 k it means the intervals don't touch and we can shrink the window.

The sloppy solution provided in the editorial can be simplified with one trick. If the intervals don't overlap for the number on left, it will surely overlap for the one next to it in left + 1. Because even if bigger by 1, the next element will + k will intersect with number at right - k.

## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBeauty(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int right = 0;  // Pointer for the end of the valid range
        int maxBeauty = 0;

        // Iterate through the array with the left pointer
        for (int left = 0; left < nums.size(); left++) {
            // Expand the right pointer while the range condition is met
            while (right < nums.size() && nums[right] - nums[left] <= 2 * k) {
                right++;
            }
            // Update the maximum beauty based on the current range
            // We do not add 1 here as right is already pointing to one position
            // beyond the valid range.
            maxBeauty = max(maxBeauty, right - left);
        }
        return maxBeauty;
    }
};
```
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBeauty(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        while (right < nums.size()) {
            if (nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k) 
                left += 1;
            right++;
        }

        return right - left;
    }
};

# Approach: Binary Search
When I hear binary search, I immediately get frustrated on how could you possibly use this technique. 
Well, its easy, you sort the numbers, and then for each number you search for the furthest one that could be in a valid range. Then the beauty is the maximum of the numbers from this current number and that furthest number.

What is the furthest number? well if the valid range for two numbers x and y is such that x + k >= y - k then y <= x + 2k. so we are looking for y. if y is the furthest one that will overlap, then every element between then will also overlap.

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Find the farthest index where the value is within the range
            // [nums[i], nums[i] + 2*k]
            int upperBound = findUpperBound(nums, nums[i] + 2 * k);
            // Update the maximum beauty based on the current range
            maxBeauty = max(maxBeauty, upperBound - i + 1);
        }
        return maxBeauty;
    }

private:
    // Helper function to find the largest index where arr[index] <= val
    int findUpperBound(vector<int>& arr, int val) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1, result = 0;

        // Perform binary search to find the upper bound
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] <= val) {
                result = mid;  // Update the result and move to the right half
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;  // Move to the left half
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
