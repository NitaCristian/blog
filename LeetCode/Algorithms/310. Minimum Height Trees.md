# Approach: Topological sorting
The **_height_** of a tree can be defined as the _maximum distance_ between the root and all its leaf nodes.
The rooted trees with the minimum height all have equal distance from them to the leaves.

So we start from the leaves, and eliminate them.
Then the next nodes become leaves and we eliminate them again.
Until the remaining layer of nodes which represent the nodes we can select as roots for the minimum height trees.

    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        degree = [0] * n
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            degree[v] += 1
            graph[v].append(u)
            degree[u] += 1

        queue = deque()
        for node in range(n):
            if degree[node] == 1:
                queue.append(node)
        
        answer = []
        while queue:
            answer = list(queue)
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                curr = queue.popleft()
                degree[curr] -= 1
                for neighbor in graph[curr]:
                    degree[neighbor] -= 1
                    if degree[neighbor] == 1:
                        queue.append(neighbor)

        return answer if answer else [0]
