# Approach: Sliding Window Frequency
Basic sliding window technique using a frequency map.
Traverse the elements and store their frequency. 
If the greatest element is at a distance greater than 2 from the smallest element present in the map then we have to shrink the window. 
As we shrink the window if the frequency is 0 we have to remove the element from the map using erase.
How do we count the number of array tough?
Well, for three elements we have 6 subarrays and as we traverse each element, we add the length of the current subarray to a variable count.
It is going to sum up like this: 1 + 2 + 3. which is exactly how many subarrays we have with 3 elements.
