# Approach: DFS
The diameter of an N-ary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in the tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the root.

This is what the problem states.
So now i am thinking that I have two choices in order to find the maximum diameter of this n-ary tree.
One is that that current node is like an inflection point, you have some distance from one side plus another distance from another side and combined they make the maximum distance.
The other one is that the current node just contributes to the maximum diameter, so we only take the maximum distance it can have and pass it further.

We define a dfs function that for each child determines its maximum height + 1, the plus 1 means the current edge made by the root and the child.
Then the maximum distance is either the greatest two distances combined, or I can't determine the maximum just yet and i return the greatest height currently.

            for child in root.children:
                length = dfs(child) + 1
                if length > first:
                    second = first
                    first = length
                elif length > second:
                    second = length

            max_diameter = max(max_diameter, first + second)
            return first

        dfs(root)
        return max_diameter
