# Approach: Dynamic Programming/ Greedy
In a brute force approach we would take every two pairs of sightseeing spots and check which one yields the best score.

In the brute force solution, you iterate over **all possible pairs** of indices $(i, j)$ to compute:
$$
values[i] + values[j] + i - j
$$
This leads to **O(N^2)** complexity because you check all combinations. The inefficiency arises because you **recompute** $values[i]+i$ for every j, even if you’ve already computed it before.

Notice that the formula can be split as:
$$
(values[i]+i)+(values[j]−j)
$$
The left part $(values[i] + i)$ is independent of j and can be computed and stored ahead of time.
But for this problem we only need to keep track of the best left-side score at every point j.
This means we can compute this left-side maximum dynamically as we traverse the array.

The first and left-most sightseeing spot is the one at index 0.
Starting from index 1 we traverse the array and compute the current right-side score, the maximum score, and update the best left-side score.

class Solution:
    def maxScoreSightseeingPair(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(values)

        max_left_score = values[0]
        max_score = 0

        for i in range(1, n):
            current_right_score = values[i] - i
            max_score = max(max_score, max_left_score + current_right_score)

            current_left_score = values[i] + i
            max_left_score = max(max_left_score, current_left_score)

        return max_score
```
