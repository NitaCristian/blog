# Problem Statement
You are given two strings `start` and `target`, both of length `n`. Each string consists **only** of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'` where:

- The characters `'L'` and `'R'` represent pieces, where a piece `'L'` can move to the **left** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its left, and a piece `'R'` can move to the **right** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its right.
- The character `'_'` represents a blank space that can be occupied by **any** of the `'L'` or `'R'` pieces.

Return `true` _if it is possible to obtain the string_ `target` _by moving the pieces of the string_ `start` _**any** number of times_. Otherwise, return `false`.
## Constraints
- `n == start.length == target.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `start` and `target` consist of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`.
# Examples
**Example 1:**

**Input:** start = "_L__R__R_", target = "L______RR"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to "**L**___R__R_".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to "L___R___**R**".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to "L______**R**R".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** start = "R_L_", target = "__LR"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain "_**R**L_".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** start = "_R", target = "R_"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The piece in the string start can move only to the right, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.
# Hints
- After some sequence of moves, can the order of the pieces change?
- Try to match each piece in s with a piece in e.
# Explanation
The hints aren't that great to be quite honest.
You can derive the brute force but hard to come up with the optimal solutions.


# Approach: Brute Force
For the brute force solution lets do exactly what the problem says and try to mach a character in start with the character in target.

For every index i check if the characters match, and if they do go to the next pair.
Now we will take an index j equal to i and start search for a string in `start` that matches the target character target[i].
If we don't find one, we should clearly return false.
Now that we have an index for the corresponding character in target, we need to try to move it in its place.

So while j is greater than i perform the following checks:
If the current character at j is \_ and the previous one is R you can swap. but if the previous one is L return false.

if the curr char is L and the prev character is \_ you can swap them and decrease j like above, otherwise if its R return false.

if the curr char is R return false regardless of what the prev char is.

finally a last else statemetn where you return false if none of those ocnditions match.

at the end of the function return true since the string passed all the tests.

public:
    bool canChange(string start, string target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
            if (target[i] == start[i])
                continue;

            int j = i;
            while (j < start.size() && target[i] != start[j])
                j++;
            
            if (j == start.size())
                return false;

            while (j > i) {
                if (start[j] == '_' && start[j - 1] == 'R') {
                    swap(start[j], start[j - 1]);
                    j--;
                } else if (start[j] == '_' && start[j - 1] == 'L') {
                    return false;
                } else if (start[j] == 'L' && start[j - 1] == '_') {
                    swap(start[j], start[j - 1]);
                    j--;
                } else if (start[j] == 'L' && start[j - 1] == 'R') {
                    return false;
                } else if (start[j] == 'R' && start[j - 1] == '_') {
                    return false;
                } else if (start[j] == 'R' && start[j - 1] == 'L') {
                    return false;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }

# Approach: Queue
Image you remove all the blank spaces
Now if the ith char is L in the start string, L should also be in the traget string. Since you can't interchange them, if this is not the case, return false.
Makes sense since we can move L and R around with \_ but never interchange them.

we can check this with another data structure.
at first i thought i can simply create two separete string without blanks and compare them. while this would work for this single problem, it doesn't solve the other problem, which is wether or not we can move the chars in their correct position.

but how do we know wheter we can move them in their right place?
if I have an L at position 5  in target and another L at position 10 in start string and they both are the ith letter, we know that there are only blank spaces between the position 10 and 5. so we can move from 10 to 5 by swapping.
So the index in start string has to be geq to index in target.
Same applies with R, but in reverse. the index has to be leq to index in target.
so at first we process both string a save each character with its position in a queue.
then we process the queues and check the above conditions.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canChange(string start, string target) {
        // Queue to store characters and indices from both strings
        queue<pair<char, int>> startQueue, targetQueue;

        // Record non-underscore characters and their indices
        for (int i = 0; i < start.size(); i++) {
            if (start[i] != '_') {
                startQueue.push({start[i], i});
            }
            if (target[i] != '_') {
                targetQueue.push({target[i], i});
            }
        }

        // If number of pieces don't match, return false
        if (startQueue.size() != targetQueue.size()) return false;

        // Compare each piece's type and position
        while (!startQueue.empty()) {
            auto [startChar, startIndex] = startQueue.front();
            startQueue.pop();
            auto [targetChar, targetIndex] = targetQueue.front();
            targetQueue.pop();

            // Check character match and movement rules
            if (startChar != targetChar ||
                (startChar == 'L' && startIndex < targetIndex) ||
                (startChar == 'R' && startIndex > targetIndex))
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
};

# Approach: Two pointers
We don't even need the queues.
simply keep track of two pointers in both string.
while we are not at the end: move them to the next chars and check the same conditions as above.

although one aditional condition must be checked
the two pointer get into position right? but what if one of them gets to the end. we this means that both of them should reach the end since they skiped all blanks, otherwise there is a character more or less in start string.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canChange(string start, string target) {
        int startLength = start.size();
        // Pointer for start string and target string
        int startIndex = 0, targetIndex = 0;

        while (startIndex < startLength || targetIndex < startLength) {
            // Skip underscores in start
            while (startIndex < startLength && start[startIndex] == '_') {
                startIndex++;
            }
            // Skip underscores in target
            while (targetIndex < startLength && target[targetIndex] == '_') {
                targetIndex++;
            }
            // If one string is exhausted, both should be exhausted
            if (startIndex == startLength || targetIndex == startLength) {
                return startIndex == startLength && targetIndex == startLength;
            }

            // Check if the pieces match and follow movement rules
            if (start[startIndex] != target[targetIndex] ||
                (start[startIndex] == 'L' && startIndex < targetIndex) ||
                (start[startIndex] == 'R' && startIndex > targetIndex))
                return false;

            startIndex++;
            targetIndex++;
        }

        // If all conditions are satisfied, return true
        return true;
    }
};
