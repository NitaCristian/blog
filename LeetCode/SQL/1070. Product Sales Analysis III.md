    min(year) over (partition by product_id) as first_year

) as a
where year = first_year
```
# Approach: Subquery

Then in an outer query select the data you want where the product and the year are in the subquery mentioned above.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select product_id, year as first_year, quantity, price
from sales
where (product_id, year) in (
    select product_id, min(year) as year
    from sales
    group by product_id
)
