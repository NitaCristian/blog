# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Group by
For every day, for every user i have to get the count of distinct articles they have saw. And this count must be greater than 1.
At the end we just want the ids of those users and ordered ascending.

We simply group by view date and viewer id having count of distinct article id greater than 1 ordered by viewer id.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct viewer_id id
from views
group by view_date, viewer_id
having count(distinct article_id) > 1
order by id
```
# Approach: Self join
Use a self join to match on view date and viewer id but make sure to include the condition that article id from 1 is less than article id from 2.
This simply makes the query return entries that have the same view date and viewer id but different articles which means the current user has seen different articles on the same day, which means the value should be returned.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct v1.viewer_id id
from views v1
join views v2 on v2.view_date = v1.view_date
    and v2.viewer_id = v1.viewer_id 
    and v2.article_id != v1.article_id
order by id
```
# Approach: CTE or Subquery + Window
Create a cte or subquere where you use a window function to count for each view date and viewer id the number of distinct articles read.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct viewer_id id 
from (
    select viewer_id, view_date,
    count(*) over (partition by viewer_id, view_date) cnt
    from (
        select distinct * from views
    ) b
) as a
where cnt > 1
order by id
```
