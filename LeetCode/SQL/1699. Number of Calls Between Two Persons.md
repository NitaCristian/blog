# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Clever group by and min max functions
the following pairs represents the same pair of two people.
person 1 id: 1 
person 2 id: 2
duration 10

person 1 id: 2
person 2 id: 1
duration: 5

So how do we turn those two pairs into the pair 1, 2, calls 2, total duration 15?
We select the minimum value for the first column, the maximum column for the second one,  the count and sum as usual.
Of course, we have to group all the entries by the ids of the people.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
SELECT LEAST(from_id, to_id) AS person1,
        GREATEST(from_id, to_id) AS person2,
        COUNT(*) AS call_count,
        SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY person1, person2;
```
