# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: CTE and Window Functions
This is a combinations of multiple problems. 
One is to rank every login for each player ordered by date.
The we have to pair the first login with the second login, count the number of pairs and divide by the total number of players.

Ranked logins? You do that with the row_number window function.
Pair each first login with the second? Using the ranks we can easily get the first and second logins, and to pair them we perform a self join on the ranked logins.
Total number of players? This is a simple count of distinct player ids.
The total fraction? ifnull -> round -> count distinct paired ids over all ids.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
with ranked_logins as (
    select 
    player_id, event_date,
    row_number() over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk
    from activity
)
select round(count(a.player_id) / (select count(distinct player_id) from activity), 2) as fraction
from ranked_logins a
join ranked_logins b on b.player_id = a.player_id and datediff(a.event_date, b.event_date) = 1 and b.rnk = 1
where a.rnk = 2
```
```sql
with ranked_logins as (
    select player_id, event_date,
    row_number() over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk
    from activity
),
paired_logins as (
    select a.player_id
    from ranked_logins a
    join ranked_logins b 
    on a.player_id = b.player_id 
        and a.rnk = 2 
        and b.rnk = 1
        and datediff(a.event_date, b.event_date) = 1
),
total_players as (
    select count(distinct player_id) as total_player_count
    from activity
)
select ifnull(round(
    count(distinct paired_logins.player_id) * 1.0 / total_players.total_player_count
, 2), 0) as fraction
from paired_logins
cross join total_players;
