# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Row Number Window Function
Use the rownumber window function in a subquery to assign each login a number. partition by player id and order by event date such that each player will have its own list of logins and the first one is the first login after the ordering.

Then in the outer query you perform a where and select the ones with rank = 1.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select player_id, event_date as first_login
from (
    select player_id,
    event_date,
    row_number() over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk
    from activity
) as ranked_logins
where rnk = 1
```
# Approach: Group by and Min
An interesting approach where you group by the player_id and select the min event date.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
SELECT
  A.player_id,
  MIN(A.event_date) AS first_login
FROM
  Activity A
GROUP BY
  A.player_id;
```
# Approach: First Value Window Function
Instead of using a subquery to perform the window function and then using a outer query to select the necessary value, you can simply use the first value window function with the same over conditions.

Must use distinct for the player id since the window function is performed again for each player_id so since there are multiple logins per player, the values are also multiple.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct player_id,
first_value(event_date) over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as first_login
from activity
```
