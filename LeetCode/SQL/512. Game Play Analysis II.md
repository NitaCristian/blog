# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: First Value
Just use the first value window function on the device id and perform the over condition on partition by player id order by event date.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct player_id,
first_value(device_id) over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as device_id
from activity
```
# Approach: Row Number
Perform a subquery for using the row number window function and select the ones with rank = 1 in the outer query
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select player_id, device_id
from (
    select player_id,
    device_id,
    row_number() over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk
    from activity
) ranked_activity
where rnk = 1
```
# Approach: Subquery and Group by
From the previous problem we know how to get the player id with the first login date using the group by and the min function.
Now we use that as a subquery to select the player_id and device_id
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select player_id, device_id
from activity
where (player_id, event_date) in (
    select player_id, min(event_date)
    from activity
    group by player_id
)
```
