# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Window function
First of all skip the first 6 rows. 
Then select the distinct day, ans sum the total amount over a window of an interval of 6 days from the preceding rows and the current row.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select 
    distinct visited_on,
    sum(amount) over w as amount,
    round((sum(amount) over w)/7, 2) as average_amount
from customer
    WINDOW w AS ( 
            order by visited_on
            range between interval 6 day PRECEDING and current row
    )
    Limit 6, 999
```
# Approach: Subquery
Use subqueries for the total and average amount as well as the date the calculations should start.
The calculations start on the minimum day from the table plus 6 days.

Then the sums and averages can be computed using subqueries where the dates fall between the current date and the date before 6 days.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
SELECT
    visited_on,
    (
        SELECT SUM(amount)
        FROM customer
        WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
    ) AS amount,
    ROUND(
        (
            SELECT SUM(amount) / 7
            FROM customer
            WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
        ),
        2
    ) AS average_amount
FROM customer c
WHERE visited_on >= (
        SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
        FROM customer
    )
GROUP BY visited_on;
```
