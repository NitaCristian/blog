# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Union and join 1
Create a cte with the categories and the relevant interval values for each category.
Then select each category from the cte and left join with the accounts table on the income being between start and end interval.
To select the count, you use the function on the account id.
The categories are constructed in the cte using union all.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
with categories as (
    select 'Low Salary' as 'name', 0 as 'start', 19999 as 'end'
    union all
    select 'Average Salary', 20000, 50000
    union all
    select 'High Salary', 50001, 2147483647
)
select c.name category, count(a.account_id) accounts_count
from categories c
left join accounts a on a.income between c.start and c.end
group by c.name
```
# Approach: Union and join 2
create separate selects for each category and also perform the count in that individual query.
Use the sum function and inside use case when the income is between the respective interval range.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
SELECT 
    'Low Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts
    
UNION
SELECT  
    'Average Salary' category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
    AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts

UNION
SELECT 
    'High Salary' category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income > 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts
```
