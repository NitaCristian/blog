# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Window Function
Select the project id and the employee id from the project table joined with the employee table. Also select a rank for each of these pairs where the rank is based on the number of experience years. It should be done per project.

Then you create an outer select statement and select the pairs with rank 1.

You can also use max as a window function and basically create a new column where you store the maximum experience years per project for every project employee pair then you perform a simple where filter.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select project_id, employee_id
from (
    select p.project_id, p.employee_id,
    rank() over (partition by project_id order by e.experience_years desc) as rnk
    from project p
    join employee e on e.employee_id = p.employee_id
) as a
where rnk = 1
```
```sql
WITH window_employee AS (
SELECT project_id
, employee_id
, experience_years
, MAX(experience_years) OVER (PARTITION BY project_id) AS max_experience
FROM Project
JOIN Employee
    USING (employee_id)
)

SELECT project_id, employee_id
FROM window_employee
WHERE experience_years = max_experience
```
# Approach: CTE
Create a CTE where you select the project id and employee id along with their experience years.
Then you should create a separate cte but a subquery works fine. 
You need another table where with the project id and the max experience years per each project.
Then you join these two tables on the project id and employee experience to match the maximum one per project.
Finally show the necessary columns.

Why group by 1? that is the first column in the select list and really should be project_id.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
with cte as (
    select p.project_id, e.employee_id, e.experience_years
    from project p
    join employee e using (employee_id)
)
select a.project_id, employee_id
from cte a
join (
    select project_id, max(experience_years) as max_experience
    from cte
    group by 1
) b on a.project_id = b.project_id and a.experience_years = b.max_experience
```
