# Problem Statement
Table: `Prices`

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.

Table: `UnitsSold`

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. `average_price` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** 
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+
**Output:** 
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
**Explanation:** 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96
# Approach
One thing to note here is that product_id, start_date, end_date represent the primary key for the prices table.
When we want to match the product price with its number of units sold we need to take into consideration the selling period.

The product with id 1 has been sold for 200 units for a period between 10.1.2024 and 10.2.2024 with a price of 40.
That same product with id 1 could have been sold for 100 units for another period and some other amount of money.

This just helps us match each product price with its units sold.
Then to solve the problem we simply group by the product id.
The average selling price for each product is the sum of price times the units we just matched over the sum of units.

Keep in mind if this is null, we should return 0 for that entry.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select p.product_id, ifnull(round(sum(p.price * us.units) / sum(us.units), 2), 0) average_price
from prices p 
left join unitssold us on us.product_id = p.product_id and us.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by p.product_id
```
