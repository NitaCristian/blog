# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Union
There is no other way than to union all the rows. 
You need to individually select all products with each store and their price.
First select the product id, the string 'store1' as the label store and then the price at the column store1 where that price is not null.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select product_id, 'store1' as store, store1 as price
from products 
where store1 is not null

union
select product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 as price
from products
where store2 is not null

union
select product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 as price
from products
where store3 is not null
```
