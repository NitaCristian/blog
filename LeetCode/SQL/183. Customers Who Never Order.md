# Approach: Left join null trick
Match every customer with their orders. Use left join such that you can obtain the customers even if they don't have any matching orders.
Now filter the result set where the order id is null. This will only be valid for the customers who don't have a matching entry in the orders table.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select c.name as customers
from customers c
left join orders o on o.customerId = c.id
where o.id is null
```
