# Approach
Select the name and bonus of every employee whose bonus is less than 1000. Don't forget that not every employee has a bonus, thus check for null.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select e.name, b.bonus
from employee e
left join bonus b on b.empId = e.empId
where bonus is null or bonus < 1000
```
