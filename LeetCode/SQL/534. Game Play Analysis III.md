## Example 1

# Approach: Sum as Window Function
Didn't know this but sum can be used as a window function.
Reading the problem statement you figure out you need some sort of prefix sum or cumulative sum function such that for each player you list out the dates they played and then perform this prefix sum on the number of games they played.
So in the first day you have 5 games, then by the second day, they have played 5 + 10 more games, and so on.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select 
player_id, 
event_date, 
sum(games_played) over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as games_played_so_far
from activity
```
