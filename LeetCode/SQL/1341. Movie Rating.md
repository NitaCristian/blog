# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Union all
Even the problem statement gives the actual problem split into two queries. Perform them separately and join the result using union all.
Basically freestyle. Make sure for the last one the average rating only for February.

Select the name from the movie rating table joined with the users table grouped by name, ordered by count of movies rated descending and ascending by name, limit to 1 result.

Select the title from the movie rating table joined with the movies table on the id where the date is only in February, grouped by title, order by average rating descending and title ascending and limit to 1 result.

Union both of those results and you have your answer.
## Code

(select name as results

group by name
order by count(*) desc, name
limit 1)

union all

(select title as results
from movierating
join movies using(movie_id)
where created_at < '2020-03-01' and created_at >= '2020-02-01'
group by title
order by avg(rating) desc, title

```
