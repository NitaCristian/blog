# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Left join
Select every user and match them with their rides.
Sum the distances.
Some users may not have rides, but we still need them so we use left join. 
If the total distance traveled is null, then we output 0.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select u.name, ifnull(sum(r.distance), 0) travelled_distance
from users u
left join rides r on r.user_id = u.id
group by u.id
order by travelled_distance desc, name asc
```
