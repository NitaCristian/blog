## Example 1

# Approach: CTE with union all
With the way the table matches is made i can't do anything useful.
I want a list such that for every team it is displayed its id and the number of points after a match.
I have to do this twice, once for the host teams and then for the away teams. This is because if I only process one side, I will miss the teams from the other side.
So i select the team id then i compute its score after a match. I union all with the guest teams. 
Then I select every team, join it with the cte above, group by id and compute the number of points. At the end i apply the ordering.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
with scores as (
    select host_team as team_id, 
    case 
        when host_goals > guest_goals then 3
        when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
        else 0
    end as score
    from matches

    union all

    select guest_team as team_id,
    case
        when guest_goals > host_goals then 3
        when guest_goals = host_goals then 1
        else 0
    end as score
    from matches
)
select t.team_id, t.team_name, ifnull(sum(s.score), 0) num_points
from teams t
left join scores s using (team_id)
group by t.team_id
order by num_points desc, t.team_id
