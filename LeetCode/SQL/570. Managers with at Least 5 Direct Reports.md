# Problem Statement
Table: `Employee`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.

Write a solution to find managers with at least **five direct reports**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** 
Employee table:

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

**Output:** 

| name |
|------|
| John |
# Approach: Self Join
Match each employee with its manager using a self join.
Group by the manager id and select the name of the manager number of employees is at least 5.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select b.name
from employee a
join employee b on b.id = a.managerId
group by b.id
having count(*) >= 5
```
