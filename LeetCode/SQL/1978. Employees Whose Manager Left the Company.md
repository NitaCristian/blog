# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Left join
First of all implement the basic requirements of the query without the constraint of the manager.
Then make sure to only look at the employees that have a manager id.
Then this is the point where you could implement the final requirement multiples ways.

This time, you are going to use a left join to match every employee with its manager but specify that the where clause specify that the employee id of the manager is null.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select e.employee_id
from employees e
left join employees m on m.employee_id = e.manager_id
where e.salary < 30000 and e.manager_id is not null and m.employee_id is null
order by e.employee_id
```
# Approach: Subquery
The other method to specify that a manager is no longer present in the table is to use a subquery in the where clause where you say that the manager id not in (select all employee ids).
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000 AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY employee_id;
```
