# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: CTE and Window
First of all we need for each user and for each product they bought, the total spending amount.
The with this we can rank those amounts per user.
Finally we return the user and product ids with rank = 1.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
with user_product_spending as (
    select s.user_id, s.product_id, sum(price * quantity) as spent
    from sales s
    join product p using (product_id)
    group by s.user_id, s.product_id
), user_product_spending_ranked as (
    select user_id, product_id,
    rank() over (partition by user_id order by spent desc) as rnk
    from user_product_spending
)
select user_id, product_id
from user_product_spending_ranked
where rnk = 1
```
