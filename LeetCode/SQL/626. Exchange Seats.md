# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: If and hopes
Lets see what are the rules.
If the current id is odd we swap it with id + 1.
If its even, then we swap it with id - 1.
So 1 swaps with 2, and 2 swaps with 1.

But if the last id is equal to the last one?
Well if the last one is even, you swap it with id - 1.
Else it remains the same since you can't swap it with anyone.

I thought I should create an update statement but a query is enough since it can also be used to update the table.
I thought I had to swap the names of the students but it is the same thing.
Make sure to order by id at the end.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select 
    if (id < (select max(id) from seat), 
        if(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id + 1), 
        if(id % 2 = 0, id - 1, id)
    ) as id, student
from Seat
order by id;
```
```mysql
UPDATE Seat AS s1
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        id AS current_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
            WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN id - 1
            ELSE id
        END AS new_id
    FROM Seat
) AS derived
ON s1.id = derived.current_id
SET s1.id = derived.new_id;
