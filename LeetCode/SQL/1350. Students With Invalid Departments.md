# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Left join
Select the students and match them with their departments using a left join since we need all students, not only the ones that have a department.
Now we filter the students for the ones who have a department id to null due to the left join.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select s.id, s.name
from students s
left join departments d on d.id = s.department_id
where d.id is null
```
