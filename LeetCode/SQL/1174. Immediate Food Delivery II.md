# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach CTE
Lets break down the problem in smaller subproblems that we can solve individually.

We need to find the first orders of each customer.
To do this, we use the row number window function and partition by customer id order by order date.
What this basically does is it groups the entries by customer_id then it orders them by order_date. Then based on this grouping and ordering, it assigns each entry a number. 
Think of it like this, we want the first order so to do this we order by date increasing. To get the first order for each customer we also have to group by customer id. Then to actually assign the orders a rank, we use row num function.

Now we can find the first orders by selecting the ones with rnk = 1.
But now we also need to find the count of the imediate orders, the ones who have order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date. Not only imediate orders, but first imediate orders. Thus we perform a simple count on the first_orders cte with the constraints specified above.

We create another cte for the total customers and then combine them into the last select statement which just computes the percentage.
## Code
### MySQL
```mysql
with first_orders as (
    select
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        customer_pref_delivery_date,
        row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) as rnk
    from
        delivery
),
immediate_orders as (
    select
        count(*) as immediate_count
    from
        first_orders
    where
        rnk = 1 and order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date
),
total_customers as (
    select
        count(distinct customer_id) as total_customers
    from
        delivery
)
select
    round((immediate_orders.immediate_count * 100.0) / total_customers.total_customers, 2) as immediate_percentage
from
    immediate_orders, total_customers;
```
