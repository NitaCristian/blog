# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Case when
Group by sale date because you want the difference for each day.
How do you compute the difference since this problem may look like i have to select only one type of fruit and then join it with the other type.
You can use the sum function and in there put an expression.
The expression is a case when such that if the fruit is apple the number is positive, else its negative, meaning subtraction.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select sale_date, sum(case when fruit = 'apples' then sold_num else -sold_num end) as 'diff'
from sales
group by sale_date
order by sale_date
```
# Approach: Self join
I have described this approach above.
Filter the table to only have apples.
Then self join with the table and filter for oranges.
Then perform the difference.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select a.sale_date, (a.sold_num - b.sold_num) as 'diff'
from sales a
join sales b on b.sale_date = a.sale_date and b.fruit = 'oranges'
where a.fruit = 'apples'
group by a.sale_date
order by a.sale_date
```
