# Approach: AVG Function Trick
avg function takes the average of some numeric value. In this case we can substitute it for some boolean expression that returns 0 or 1.
We use the condition given in the problem statement inside the avg function which now will run over the entire dataset. The count of all rows that follow that condition over the internal count of all rows processed.

This problem could've been solved using a subquery or cte and using normal count functions.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select round(avg(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) as immediate_percentage
from delivery
```
