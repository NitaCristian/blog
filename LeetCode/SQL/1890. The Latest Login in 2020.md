# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Rank
Select the user id and the time stamp from the logins table where the year is 2020. To this, assign them a rank per user id based on the timestamp.
In the outer query select the one with rank 1.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select user_id, time_stamp as last_stamp
from (
select user_id, time_stamp,
rank() over (partition by user_id order by time_stamp desc) rnk
from logins
where year(time_stamp) = 2020
) a
where rnk = 1
```
# Approach: Group by and max
Group all the logins by user. Filter the ones for the year 2020.
Out of those, for each user, select the max logins time stamp.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select user_id, max(time_stamp) as last_stamp
from logins
where year(time_stamp) = 2020
group by user_id
```
# Approach: First value
Use the first value window function.
Same as the rank function.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct user_id,
first_value(time_stamp) over (partition by user_id order by time_stamp desc) as last_stamp
from logins
where year(time_stamp) = 2020
```
