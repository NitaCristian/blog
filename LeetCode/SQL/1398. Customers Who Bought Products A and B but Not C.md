# Approach: Group by and sum
This approach felt more like a trick than a proper solution.
Join the customers with their orders and group the result by the customer id. Now we need to count the number of orders with name 'A' and 'B' to be greater than 0 and that the count of orders 'C' is 0.
To do this we use the sum function and inside we put a boolean expression where we check the product names.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select c.customer_id, c.customer_name
from customers c
join orders o using (customer_id)
group by c.customer_id
having sum(product_name = 'A') > 0 and sum(product_name = 'B') > 0 and sum(product_name = 'C') = 0
order by c.customer_id
```
