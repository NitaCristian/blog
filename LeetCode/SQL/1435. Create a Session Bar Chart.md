# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: CTE with data needed
We need a table such that when we select from it all the bins show up even the ones that are 0.
Ok so we create a cte with the bins and the start and end of each interval. 
Then when we select from the bins we left join the sessions table and match on the duration. The duration is divided by 60 to get the minutes and is attributed to the bins that fit in the interval.
Then grup by bins and count the number of sessions for each bin.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
with bins as (
    select '[0-5>' as 'bin', 0 as 'start', 5 as 'end'
    union all
    select '[5-10>', 5, 10
    union all
    select '[10-15>', 10, 15
    union all
    select '15 or more', 15, 2147483647
)
select b.bin, count(s.duration) as total
from bins b
left join sessions s on (s.duration / 60) >= b.start and (s.duration / 60) < b.end
group by b.bin
```
