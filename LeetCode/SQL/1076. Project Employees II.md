# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Rank
Select each project_id and assign it a rank based on the count of employees working at that project. Ids with the same count will have the same rank and we are interested only in the ones with rank = 1.

Use an outer select query to select the project ids with rank = 1.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select project_id
from (SELECT 
    project_id,
    COUNT(1) AS s,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rnk
FROM project p
GROUP BY project_id
) as s
where rnk = 1
```
# Approach: Subquery
Select the project id group by id having count = ().
In there select the max count. To do this you use count and group by then order descending by this count and limit to the first.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select project_id
from project 
group by project_id
having count(*) = (
    select count(*)
    from project 
    group by project_id
    order by count(*) desc
    limit 1
)
```
