## Example 1

# Approach: Tricky having clause
We select all the customers and match them with their orders, and the orders with their products.
Then we want to display the results per use so we group by customer_id.
The year should be 2020 for all entries so we filter by it. 
But the sum for month 6 and for month 7 should both be greater than or equal to 100. 
So this is what we put in the having clause, the sum of quantity times prices if month = 6 geq 100 and the sum of quantity times prices if month = 7 geq 100.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select customer_id, name
from customers 
join orders using (customer_id)
join product using (product_id)
where year(order_date) = 2020
group by customer_id
having sum(if(month(order_date) = 6, quantity, 0) * price) >= 100 
    and sum(if(month(order_date) = 7, quantity, 0) * price) >= 100
```
