# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Basic Functions
To solve this problem you first have to figure out how to format the date such that you only have the year and the month. To do this you use the built-in function date_format.

Then you seen to have to group by that date and the country. This is a simple group by statement.
Then we are interested in the total count of transfers and then only the ones that are approved. You use count(\*) or count with a case when inside. same with the sum function.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select 
    date_format(trans_date, '%Y-%m') month,
    country, 
    count(*) trans_count,
    count(case when state = 'approved' then 1 end) approved_count,
    sum(amount) trans_total_amount,
    sum(case when state = 'approved' then amount else 0 end) approved_total_amount
from transactions
group by month, country
```
