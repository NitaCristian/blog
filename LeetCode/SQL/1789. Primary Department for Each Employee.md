# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Union all
There are two distinct conditions here to be met. 
One is that the employee belongs to multiple departments and that the primary one has a flag of 'Y'.
The other one is that the employee belongs to only one department.
Thus we combine the two selects using a union all.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select employee_id, department_id
from employee
where primary_flag = 'Y'

union all

select employee_id, department_id
from employee
group by employee_id
having count(department_id) = 1
```
# Approach: Window function
Using a window function in a subquery we count the number of departments each employee belongs to and then in the outer query we select the ones with count = 1 or primary flag = 'Y'
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select employee_id, department_id
from (
    select *,
    count(employee_id) over (partition by employee_id) as employeeCount
    from employee
) as a
where employeeCount = 1 or primary_flag = 'Y'
```
