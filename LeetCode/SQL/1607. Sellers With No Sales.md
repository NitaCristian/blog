# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Subquery
This approach can also be used as a left join.

Select all the sellers who made a sale in 2020.
Then in the outer query, select the seller names for those whose id's are not in the above subquery.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select seller_name
from seller
where seller_id not in (
    select distinct seller_id
    from orders 
	where year(sale_date) = 2020
)
order by seller_name
```
# Approach: Group and join
Join each seller with their orders.
This can be null so we use left join.
Then group by the sellers id and select those that haven't sold in 2020.
This can be check using the having clause. 
Sum a boolean expression where you check the sale year is 2020. 
This sum should equal 0 if they haven't made a sale in 2020.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select seller_name
from seller
left join orders using (seller_id)
group by seller_id
having sum(ifnull(year(sale_date) = 2020, 0)) = 0
order by seller_name
```
