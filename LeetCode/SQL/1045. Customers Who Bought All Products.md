# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach
Group by customer id and select the ones that have the count of products bought equal to the total count of products in the table products.
Keep in mind that a customer could've bought multiples of one product, thus select the distinct count of product bought.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select customer_id
from customer
group by customer_id
having count(distinct product_key) = (
    select count(product_key) from product
)
```
