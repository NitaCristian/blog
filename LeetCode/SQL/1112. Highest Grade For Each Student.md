# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Window function
Select every entry and assign it a rank. 
The rank is per student and should be given by the highest rank and if the ranks match, to the lowest course_id.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select student_id, course_id, grade
from (
    select *,
    rank() over (partition by student_id order by grade desc, course_id asc) as rnk
    from enrollments
) a
where rnk = 1
```
# Approach: Subquery
For each student, select its max grade.
Then for each student select the entries that match the student id and the maximum grade, then for those select the minimum course_id.

This can also be another approach where you use a join instead of a subquery
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select student_id, min(course_id) course_id, grade
from enrollments
where (student_id, grade) in (
    select student_id, max(grade)
    from enrollments
    group by student_id
)
group by student_id, grade
order by student_id
```
