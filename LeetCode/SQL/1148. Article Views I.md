# Problem Statement
Table: `Views`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |

There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** 
Views table:

| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

**Output:** 

| id   |
|------|
| 4    |
| 7    |

# Approach
We need to return the id of the authors who viewed their own articles.
The tables `Views` records the id of the viewer who viewed an article, but also information about the articles itself like its own unique id and the author's id.

Thus we need to select the distinct authors whose author_id is also the viewer_id.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct author_id id
from views
where author_id = viewer_id
order by id asc
```
