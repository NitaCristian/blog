# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Self join
Select every number from the logs.
Using joins select the previous and next numbers by id.
Then use a where clause to filter only the consecutive ones and finally select the distinct numbers that follow this rule.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select distinct b.num as ConsecutiveNums
from logs b
join logs a on a.id = b.id - 1
join logs c on c.id = b.id + 1
where a.num = b.num and b.num = c.num
```
