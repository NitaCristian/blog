# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Group by
Group the table by day since we want to see the results per day.
Then we want to see for each day the total time per employee, so we also group by employee_id.
Finally for each employee we sum up the time spent in the office.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select event_day as 'day',
emp_id,
sum(out_time - in_time) as total_time
from employees
group by event_day, emp_id
```
