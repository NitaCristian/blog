# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Join
This one is a bit tricky.

You need to do two things: 
- get every combination of student and subject 
- combine a student with their examinations and  perform the counting

Initially, you join the students table with the examinations table and perform the group by, order by and the count to get the result.
But you can notice that students don't attend exams for all subjects, and since that information is not present in the table, the count won't show up as 0.

You need to perform a cross join to get every student and subject combination, then do a left join with the examinations table on the student_id and subject_name. Then simply perform the group by and the order by operations on the data.

The first solution is the editorial solution and performs the calculations in a subquery, but this isn't necessary.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select
    s.student_id, s.student_name, su.subject_name, ifnull(grouped.attended_exams, 0) attended_exams
from students s
cross join subjects su
left join (
    select student_id, subject_name, count(*) attended_exams
    from examinations
    group by student_id, subject_name
) grouped on s.student_id = grouped.student_id and su.subject_name = grouped.subject_name
order by s.student_id, su.subject_name
```
```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id, 
    s.student_name, 
    su.subject_name, 
    IFNULL(COUNT(e.student_id), 0) AS attended_exams
FROM students s
CROSS JOIN subjects su
LEFT JOIN examinations e 
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND su.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, su.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, su.subject_name;
