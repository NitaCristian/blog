# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: Union and not in
Select the ids where the id is not in the other table.
Then union and order by id.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
(select employee_id 
from salaries
where employee_id not in (
    select employee_id 
    from employees
)

union 

select employee_id
from employees
where employee_id not in (
    select employee_id
    from salaries
))
order by employee_id
```
# Approach: Left and right joins
Select employees two times, one with left join with salaries and one with right join on salaries.
For the left join we can ask where salary is null, and for the right join we can ask about name is null.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
select employee_id
from (
    select * 
    from employees
    left join salaries using (employee_id)

    union
    select * 
    from employees
    right join salaries using (employee_id)
) a
where salary is null or name is null
order by employee_id
```
