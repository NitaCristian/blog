# Problem Statement

# Examples
## Example 1

# Approach: CTE and Logic
This can't be made into a single select.
The way to do this is to compute things separately and combine them later.
It is clear that we can have some months from one table, and some from the other table. How do we combine them? How do we make them count correctly the transactions and the charge back on their respective months even if they have the same id?

Sounds too complicated so lets simplify things?
Can you get all the data related to charge backs only? Format the table accordingly to have the same columns.
Then can you get all the data related only to transactions? Like their count and sum? Of course! Just like above using simple group by, sum, count statements.

We can then use union all on all of this data and then select everything from this combined data.
## Code
### MySQL
```sql
WITH ChargebackData AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(c.trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
        t.country,
        0 AS approved_count,
        0 AS approved_amount,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.trans_id) AS chargeback_count,
        SUM(t.amount) AS chargeback_amount
    FROM Chargebacks c
    JOIN Transactions t
        ON c.trans_id = t.id
    GROUP BY month, t.country
),
ApprovedData AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
        country,
        COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS approved_count,
        SUM(amount) AS approved_amount,
        0 AS chargeback_count,
        0 AS chargeback_amount
    FROM Transactions
    WHERE state = 'approved'
    GROUP BY month, country
),
CombinedData AS (
    SELECT * FROM ChargebackData
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM ApprovedData
)
SELECT 
    t0.month,
    t0.country,
    SUM(t0.approved_count) AS approved_count,
    SUM(t0.approved_amount) AS approved_amount,
    SUM(t0.chargeback_count) AS chargeback_count,
    SUM(t0.chargeback_amount) AS chargeback_amount
FROM CombinedData t0
GROUP BY t0.month, t0.country
ORDER BY t0.month, t0.country;
