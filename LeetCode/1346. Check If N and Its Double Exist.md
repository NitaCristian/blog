# Problem Statement
Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exist two indices `i` and `j` such that :

- `i != j`
- `0 <= i, j < arr.length`
- `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`
## Constraints
- `2 <= arr.length <= 500`
- `-103 <= arr[i] <= 103`
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** arr = `[10,2,5,3]`
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** For i = 0 and j = 2, `arr[i]` == 10 == 2 * 5 == 2 * `arr[j]`
# Hints
- Loop from i = 0 to arr.length, maintaining in a hashTable the array elements from `[0, i - 1]`.
- On each step of the loop check if we have seen the element `2 * arr[i]` so far.
- Also check if we have seen `arr[i] / 2` in case `arr[i] % 2 == 0`.
# Explanation
There are multiple ways for solving this problem.

The brute force would simply be to loop over all the elements and for each element, loop over them again and check if one is the double of the other.
This however would take a total time complexity of $n^2$ and using specialized data structures we could reduce this time complexity at the cost of space complexity.
# Approach: Set
We could iterate over all the elements and check if its double has already been seen, or if the number is even, if its half has been seen.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkIfExist(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        for (const auto &num : arr) {
            if (seen.count(num * 2) || num % 2 == 0 && seen.count(num / 2))
                return true;

            seen.insert(num);
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```
### C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CheckIfExist(int[] arr) {
        var seen = new HashSet<int>();

        foreach (var num in arr) {
            if (seen.Contains(num * 2) || num % 2 == 0 && seen.Contains(num / 2))
                return true;

            seen.Add(num);
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()

        for num in arr:
            if 2 * num in seen or num % 2 == 0 and num // 2 in seen:
                return True

            seen.add(num)

        return False
```
## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The algorithm iterates through the array `arr` once, processing each element individually. For each element, it performs two operations:

1. Checking if 2Ã—num or num/2 is in the set, which takes O(1) on average due to the constant-time lookup in the set.
2. Adding the current element to the set, which also takes O(1) on average for each insertion.

Since both operations inside the loop take constant time, and the loop runs `n` times, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
### Space Complexity
The primary space usage comes from the set, which stores up to `n` unique elements from the array `arr`. In the worst case, when all elements are unique, the set will contain `n` elements, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).

No additional significant data structures are used, so the auxiliary space complexity is O(1). Therefore, the total space complexity is O(n).

# Approach: Frequency Map
If the problem restricted the numbers to only positive numbers we could use a frequency array since the problem constrains allow us.
However, in this case the numbers can also be negative and we have to use a frequency map.

We have to be careful of the number 0, since 0 is its double, we have to make sure the count is greater than 1.
## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkIfExist(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (int num : arr) freq[num]++;
        
        for (int num : arr)
            if (freq.contains(num * 2) && num != 0 || freq[0] > 1)
                return true;
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
### C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CheckIfExist(int[] arr) {
        var freq = new Dictionary<int, int>();

        foreach (var num in arr) 
            if (freq.ContainsKey(num))
                freq[num]++;
            else 
                freq[num] = 1;

        foreach (var num in arr) 
            if (freq.ContainsKey(num * 2) && num != 0 || num == 0 && freq[num] > 1)
                return true;

        return false;
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        freq = {}

        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

        for num in arr:
            if 2 * num in freq and num != 0 or num == 0 and freq[num] > 1:
                return True

        return False
```
## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The algorithm consists of two main loops. The first loop iterates through the array `arr` and inserts or updates each element in the hash map. The insertion operation in the hash map takes O(1) on average, so the time complexity of this loop is O(n).

The second loop also iterates through the array `arr` and performs constant-time operations for each element, including lookups in the hash map (which are O(1) on average). Therefore, the time complexity of this loop is also O(n).

As a result, the overall time complexity is O(n)+O(n)=O(n)
### Space Complexity
The space complexity is dominated by the hash map, which stores up to `n` unique elements from the array `arr`. Each key-value pair in the hash map consumes space, so in the worst case, the space required is proportional to the number of unique elements in `arr`, which is O(n).

No additional data structures that depend on the size of the input are used, so the auxiliary space is O(1). Therefore, the total space complexity is O(n).
# Approach: Sort with Binary Search

## Code
### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkIfExist(vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            int target = 2 * arr[i];
            int index = lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), target) - arr.begin();
            if (index >= 0 && index < arr.size() && index != i && arr[index] == target) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
### C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CheckIfExist(int[] arr) {
        Array.Sort(arr);

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++) {
            int target = arr[i] * 2;
            int index = Array.BinarySearch(arr, target);

            if (index >= 0 && index < arr.Length && index != i)
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        arr.sort()

        for i in range(len(arr)):
            target = 2 * arr[i]
            index = bisect_left(arr, target, lo=0, hi=len(arr))
            if (index >= 0 and index < len(arr) and index != i and arr[index] == target):
                return True

        return False
```
## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The sort function sorts the array in O(nlogn) time. Sorting is the most time-consuming operation here.

The for loop iterates through each element in the array, and for each element, it calls the `customBinarySearch` function. The binary search operation itself takes O(logn) time, as it divides the search space in half at each step.

Therefore, the time complexity of the loop is O(n) for iterating through the array, and for each iteration, the binary search takes O(logn). Thus, the total time complexity for the loop is O(nlogn).
### Space Complexity
The space taken by the sorting algorithm depends on the language of implementation:

In Java, `Arrays.sort()` is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of O(logn).

In C++, the `sort()` function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of O(logn).

In Python, the `sort()` method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has a space complexity of O(n).

The binary search uses constant space for variables like `left`, `right`, and `mid`. The loop also does not use any additional space other than a few variables. Therefore, the space used by the loop is O(1).
