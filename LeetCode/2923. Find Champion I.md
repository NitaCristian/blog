# Problem Statement
There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a tournament.

Given a **0-indexed** 2D boolean matrix `grid` of size `n * n`. 
For all `i, j` that `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `i != j` team `i` is **stronger** than team `j` if `grid[i][j] == 1`, otherwise, team `j` is **stronger** than team `i`.

Team `a` will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is no team `b` that is stronger than team `a`.

Return _the team that will be the champion of the tournament._
## Constraints
- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- For all `i grid[i][i]` is `0.`
- For all `i, j` that `i != j`, `grid[i][j] != grid[j][i]`.
- The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b` and team `b` is stronger than team `c`, then team `a` is stronger than team `c`.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1],\[0,0]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are two teams in this tournament. grid\[0]\[1] == 1 means that team 0 is stronger than team 1. So team 0 will be the champion.
## Example 2

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,0,1],\[1,0,1],\[0,0,0]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three teams in this tournament. grid\[1]\[0] == 1 means that team 1 is stronger than team 0. grid\[1]\[2] == 1 means that team 1 is stronger than team 2. So team 1 will be the champion.
# Hints
## Hint 1
The champion should be stronger than all the other teams.
# Explanation
The task is to identify the "champion" team in a tournament represented by a boolean matrix. The matrix shows which team is stronger than another. Specifically:
- `grid[i][j] = 1` means team `i` is stronger than team `j`.
- `grid[i][j] = 0` means team `j` is stronger than team `i`.
- There are no self-edges, meaning `grid[i][i] = 0`.
### Problem Clarification:
- We need to find the team that is stronger than all other teams. This team must have no incoming arrows (no team stronger than it).
- If multiple teams meet this condition, return `-1` (indicating there is no clear champion).
- We need to consider all `n` teams.
# Approach & Code
## Approach 1: Column-Based Check
The idea here is that a champion must not lose to any team, so in the matrix, the column, corresponding to the champion will contain all `0'`s (indicating no losses).
1. Traverse each column `j` in the matrix
2. if column `j` has no `1`'s (i.e. the team corresponding to column j loses to no one), then this team is the champion
3. If more than one team satisfies this condition, return `-1`.
## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findChampion(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            bool isChamp = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < n && isChamp; i++) {
                isChamp = grid[i][j] == 0;    
            }

            if (isChamp)
                return j;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
## C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindChampion(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.Length;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            bool isChamp = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < n && isChamp; i++) {
                isChamp = (grid[i][j] == 0);
            }
            
            if (isChamp)
                return j;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findChampion(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        
        for j in range(n):
            isChamp = True
            for i in range(n):
                isChamp = grid[i][j] == 0
                if not isChamp:
                    break

            if isChamp:
                return j

        return -1
```

## Approach 2: Elimination Method
This approach works by starting with the first team and eliminating teams that are weaker (i.e., teams that lose to the current champion).
- Start by assuming the first team is the champion.
- Iterate through the other teams, and if the current champion loses to any team (i.e., `grid[champion][i] == 0`), update the champion to that team.
- After the loop, the last remaining champion will be the strongest team if there's no ambiguity.
## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findChampion(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        int champion = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[champion][j] == 0)
                champion = j;
        }

        return champion;
    }
};
```
## C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindChampion(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.Length;

        int champion = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (grid[champion][i] == 0) 
                champion = i;
        }

        return champion;
    }
}
```
## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findChampion(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        
        champion = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if grid[champion][i] == 0:
                champion = i

        return champion
```
## Approach 3: Counting Ways
This method counts the number of wins for each team. The team with the highest number of wins is the champion.
- Count how many wins each team has by summing up the rows of the matrix.
- The team with the maximum wins is returned.
## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findChampion(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        vector<int> scores(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scores[i] = accumulate(begin(grid[i]), end(grid[i]), 0);
        }

        int champion = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (scores[i] > scores[champion])
                champion = i;
        }

        return champion;
    }
};
```
## C\#
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindChampion(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.Length;

        int[] scores = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scores[i] = grid[i].Sum();
        }

        int champion = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (scores[i] > scores[champion]) 
                champion = i;
        }
        
        return champion;
    }
}
```
## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findChampion(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        
        scores = []
        for i in range(n):
            scores.append(grid[i].count(1))

        maxScore = max(scores)
        return scores.index(maxScore)
```
# Complexity Analysis
## Time Complexity
- **Approach 1**: $O(N^2)$ because we check each element in the matrix to see if a team has no incoming edges.
- **Approach 2**: $O(N)$, because we iterate over the teams just once, updating the champion as we go.
- **Approach 3**: $O(N^2)$ due to the summation of each row, and then finding the maximum score.
## Space Complexity
- **Approach 1**: $O(1)$, as we are using only a constant amount of space.
- **Approach 2**: $O(1)$, again using only constant space.
- **Approach 3**: $O(N)$, as we need an array to store the scores of all teams.
