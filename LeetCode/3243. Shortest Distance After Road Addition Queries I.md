# Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a **unidirectional** road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.

`queries[i] = [ui, vi]` represents the addition of a new **unidirectional** road from city `ui` to city `vi`. After each query, you need to find the **length** of the **shortest path** from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the _length of the shortest path_ from city `0` to city `n - 1` after processing the **first** `i + 1` queries.
## Constraints
- `3 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n`
- `1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]`
- There are no repeated roads among the queries.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** n = 5, queries = `[[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]`
**Output:** `[3,2,1]`
**Explanation:**

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.
## Example 2
**Input:** n = 4, queries = `[[0,3],[0,2]]`
**Output:** `[1,1]`
**Explanation:**
![[Pasted image 20241127201849.png]]
After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.
# Hints
- Maintain the graph and use an efficient shortest path algorithm after each update.
- We use BFS/Dijkstra for each query.
# Explanation
From the problem statement, we know that there are `n` cities, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.
And initially, every pair of consecutive cities is connected by a one-way road.
Each element `[u, v]` of the `queries` array represents a new road to be added from node `u` to node `v`.
After adding each road, we have to determine the length of the shortest path between city `0` and city `n - 1` and store this result in an array.
# Approach 1: Breadth-First Search
The problem can be represented as a graph where cities are modeled as nodes and the roads connecting them are represented as edges. 
With this in mind, this problem becomes finding the shortest path between two nodes.

One such algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph is Dijkstra. However for this particular problem, the edges are unweighted, so finding the total cost of the shortest path is equivalent to number of steps taken to reach the destination.
As a result, we apply the BFS algorithm after each new road added to the graph.

This particular implementation of the BFS algorithm is called the Layer-by-layer BFS.

- Initialize the result array
- Initialize the adjacency list, with nodes `i` from `0` to `n - 2` connected to nodes `i + 1`
- Traverse the roads `[u, v]` from the `queries` array
	- Add `v` to `u`'s list of neighbors
	- Store the BFS algorithm's result in the `results` array
- Return the answer

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The BFS algorithm runs in relation to the nodes and edges of the graph.
Each node is added and removed from the queue exactly once, giving a time complexity of O(N) for processing all nodes.
For each node in the queue, the algorithm checks all its neighbors. All edges are examined exactly once, so the total time for edge exploration is O(E).
The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(N + E).

Each BFS after adding a road incrementally increases the edge count. The time complexity across all q queries is thus:
After the 1st road: O(n + n)
After the 2nd road: O(n + n + 1)
After the q-th road: O(n+n+q−1).
O(2qn + q(q - 1)/2)
Summing yields O(q x (n + q))
### Space Complexity
To represent our graph, we create and continuously update its adjacency list in the form of a 2D array.
Initially, this array contains `n−1` elements, and after processing all queries, the array will contain `n + q − 1` elements, finally contributing `O(n + q)` to the total space complexity.

In addition to the adjacency list, the `bfs` function creates a 1D array, named `visited` and a queue, called `nodeQueue`, both of which can have a maximum size of `n`.

Therefore, the overall space complexity remains `O(n + q)`.
