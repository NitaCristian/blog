#Graph #Array #BFS #Medium 
# Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a **unidirectional** road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.

`queries[i] = [ui, vi]` represents the addition of a new **unidirectional** road from city `ui` to city `vi`. After each query, you need to find the **length** of the **shortest path** from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the _length of the shortest path_ from city `0` to city `n - 1` after processing the **first** `i + 1` queries.
## Constraints
- `3 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n`
- `1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]`
- There are no repeated roads among the queries.
# Examples
## Example 1
**Input:** n = 5, queries = `[[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]`
**Output:** `[3,2,1]`
**Explanation:**

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.
![[Pasted image 20241127201813.png]]
After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.
## Example 2
**Input:** n = 4, queries = `[[0,3],[0,2]]`
**Output:** `[1,1]`
**Explanation:**
![[Pasted image 20241127201849.png]]
After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.
![[Pasted image 20241127201855.png]]
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.
# Hints
- Maintain the graph and use an efficient shortest path algorithm after each update.
- We use BFS/Dijkstra for each query.
# Explanation
From the problem statement, we know that there are `n` cities, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.
And initially, every pair of consecutive cities is connected by a one-way road.
Each element `[u, v]` of the `queries` array represents a new road to be added from node `u` to node `v`.
After adding each road, we have to determine the length of the shortest path between city `0` and city `n - 1` and store this result in an array.
# Approach 1: Breadth-First Search
The problem can be represented as a graph where cities are modeled as nodes and the roads connecting them are represented as edges. 
With this in mind, this problem becomes finding the shortest path between two nodes.

One such algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph is Dijkstra. However for this particular problem, the edges are unweighted, so finding the total cost of the shortest path is equivalent to number of steps taken to reach the destination.
As a result, we apply the BFS algorithm after each new road added to the graph.

This particular implementation of the BFS algorithm is called the Layer-by-layer BFS.

- Initialize the result array
- Initialize the adjacency list, with nodes `i` from `0` to `n - 2` connected to nodes `i + 1`
- Traverse the roads `[u, v]` from the `queries` array
	- Add `v` to `u`'s list of neighbors
	- Store the BFS algorithm's result in the `results` array
- Return the answer

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The BFS algorithm runs in relation to the nodes and edges of the graph.
Each node is added and removed from the queue exactly once, giving a time complexity of O(N) for processing all nodes.
For each node in the queue, the algorithm checks all its neighbors. All edges are examined exactly once, so the total time for edge exploration is O(E).
The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(N + E).

Each BFS after adding a road incrementally increases the edge count. The time complexity across all q queries is thus:
After the 1st road: O(n + n)
After the 2nd road: O(n + n + 1)
After the q-th road: O(n+n+q−1).
O(2qn + q(q - 1)/2)
Summing yields O(q x (n + q))
### Space Complexity
To represent our graph, we create and continuously update its adjacency list in the form of a 2D array.
Initially, this array contains `n−1` elements, and after processing all queries, the array will contain `n + q − 1` elements, finally contributing `O(n + q)` to the total space complexity.

In addition to the adjacency list, the `bfs` function creates a 1D array, named `visited` and a queue, called `nodeQueue`, both of which can have a maximum size of `n`.

Therefore, the overall space complexity remains `O(n + q)`.
# Approach 2: Recursive (Top-Down) Dynamic Programming
The problem constrains tell us that for every road `[u, v]`, u < v thus the final graph will never contain a cycle and can be considered a DAG.
For every node $v_i$, the distance to the final node $v_{n-1}$ only depends on:
- the distance from $v_i$ to the subsequent nodes $v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, \dots v_{n-1}$
- the distance from the subsequent nodes $v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, \dots v_{n-1}$ to the final node $v_{n-1}$
This the distance can be expressed as $distance_{v_i, v_{n-1}} = min_j(distance_{v_i, v_j}, distance_{v_j, v_{n-1}})$
We can notice that some calculations overlap but are independent of one another. This indicates that dynamic programming could help.


- Initialize a `memo` array initially with $-1$
- Create a graph representation of the problem with an adjacency list
- Traverse the `queries` array
	- Update the graph with the new road
	- Perform top-down dynamic programming and store the result
- Return the `answer` array

For the top-down DP algorithm:
- If our current position reached the final node, the distance to the final node is 0
- If we've previously computed the distance to the current node, return the result
- Compute the minimum distance
	- For every neighbor of our current node
		- Update the final result with the minimum between the current minimum distance and the minimum distance to the neighbor plus 1
- Store and return the minimum distance

            return 0;

        if (memo[curr] != -1)
            return memo[curr];

        int minDistance = n;
        for (int neighbor : graph[curr]) {
            minDistance = min(minDistance, dp(neighbor, memo, graph) + 1);
        }

        return memo[curr] = minDistance;
    }

        vector memo(n, -1);

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
he `findMinDistance` function is called on the starting node (node `0`) each time a query is processed. If the distance for a node is already computed, the function returns the cached value from the `dp` array, avoiding redundant calculations.

During its first call for node `0`, `findMinDistance` explores all neighbors, iterating over all outgoing edges. Each node is processed only once for distance calculation due to caching in the `dp` array.

The time complexity of a single `findMinDistance` call on node `0` is O(e), where e represents the current number of edges in the graph. Since each edge is visited exactly once, the computation scales linearly with the number of edges.

Thus, the total time complexity sums to:

O(n)+O(n+1)+…+O(n+q−1)=O(q×(n+q))​
### Space Complexity
- Space Complexity: O(n+q).

Once again, we choose to represent our graph using an adjacency list, the maximum size of which is O(n+q). Additionally, we create a 1D memoization array, called `dp`, with a fixed size of n and we also invoke a recursive function `findMinDistance`, whose depth is O(n), as well. Combining the above, we conclude that the total space complexity is O(n+q).
# Approach 3: Iterative (Bottom-Up) Dynamic Programming
While the top-down dynamic programming approach is often intuitive, it can become less effective in certain situations, particularly due to uncontrolled recursion depth. This is especially true for larger input sizes, where deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors. To avoid this risk, it is generally considered a good idea to convert recursive dynamic programming solutions into iterative ones.

To implement the iterative approach effectively, we need to recognize the relationship between the calls in the recursive function. We begin our computation at the base case, which occurs when `currentNode` equals `n - 1`, and work our way up to `currentNode = 0`. This means that our bottom-up approach should process nodes in reverse order, starting from `currentNode = n - 1` and building our results incrementally until we reach `currentNode = 0`. By doing so, we ensure that all necessary values are calculated before they are needed.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
- The `findMinDistance` function iterates over each edge exactly once, so its time complexity for a graph with e edges is O(e).
    
    Therefore, like the previous approaches, the total time complexity of the algorithm can be expressed as:
    
    O(n)+O(n+1)+...+O(n+q−1)=O(q×(n+q)).​
### Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(n+q).
    
The total space complexity is once again determined by the size of the adjacency list which is at most O(n+q).
